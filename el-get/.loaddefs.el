Main function to execute anything sources.

Keywords supported:
:sources :input :prompt :resume :preselect :buffer :keymap :default :history
Extra keywords are supported and can be added, see below.

When call interactively with no arguments deprecated `anything-sources'
will be used if non--nil.

PLIST is a list like (:key1 val1 :key2 val2 ...) or
\(&optional sources input prompt resume preselect buffer keymap default history).

Basic keywords are the following:

:sources

Temporary value of `anything-sources'.  It also accepts a
symbol, interpreted as a variable of an anything source.  It
also accepts an alist representing an anything source, which is
detected by (assq 'name ANY-SOURCES)

:input

Temporary value of `anything-pattern', ie. initial input of minibuffer.

:prompt

Prompt other than \"pattern: \".

:resume

If t, Resurrect previously instance of `anything'.  Skip the initialization.
If 'noresume, this instance of `anything' cannot be resumed.

:preselect

Initially selected candidate.  Specified by exact candidate or a regexp.

:buffer

`anything-buffer' instead of *anything*.

:keymap

`anything-map' for current `anything' session.

:default

A default argument that will be inserted in minibuffer with \\<minibuffer-local-map>\\[next-history-element].
When nil of not present `thing-at-point' will be used instead.

:history

By default all minibuffer input is pushed to `minibuffer-history',
if an argument HISTORY is provided, input will be pushed to HISTORY.
History element should be a symbol.

Of course, conventional arguments are supported, the two are same.

\(anything :sources sources :input input :prompt prompt :resume resume
           :preselect preselect :buffer buffer :keymap keymap :default default
           :history history)
\(anything sources input prompt resume preselect buffer keymap default history)

Other keywords are interpreted as local variables of this anything session.
The `anything-' prefix can be omitted.  For example,

\(anything :sources 'anything-c-source-buffers
           :buffer \"*buffers*\" :candidate-number-limit 10)

means starting anything session with `anything-c-source-buffers'
source in *buffers* buffer and set variable `anything-candidate-number-limit'
to 10 as session local variable.

Ensure that packages have been downloaded once and init them as needed.

`git pull', but it will ensure that:

* the packages have been installed
* load-path is set so their elisp files can be found
* Info-directory-list is set so their info files can be found
* Autoloads have been prepared and evaluated for each package
* Any post-installation setup (e.g. `(require 'feature)') happens

When SYNC is nil (the default), all installations run
concurrently, in the background.

When SYNC is 'sync, each package will be installed synchronously,
and any error will stop it all.

Please note that the `el-get-init' part of `el-get' is always
done synchronously. There's `byte-compile' support though, and
the packages you use are welcome to use `autoload' too.

PACKAGES is expected to be a list of packages you want to install
or init.  When PACKAGES is omited (the default), the list of
already installed packages is considered.
